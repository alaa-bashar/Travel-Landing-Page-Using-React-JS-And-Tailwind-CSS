# Travel App Using React Js and Tailwind CSS

Iâ€™ve been learning (React JS) and (Tailwind CSS), two of the most popular and in-demand frameworks for front-end development. ðŸš€

React JS is a JavaScript library that enables me to easily create dynamic and interactive user interfaces. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows me to customize the design of my components with minimal effort.

Iâ€™ve built this web page using React JS and Tailwind CSS to practice my skills and showcase my progress. Itâ€™s a simple but elegant landing page that demonstrates some of the features and benefits of these frameworks.

I am excited to dive deeper and deeper into these two amazing frameworks, And create more complex interfaces ISA ðŸŒŸ
